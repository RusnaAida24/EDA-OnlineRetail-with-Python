## Case Study
The transactional dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. By conducting exploratory data analysis, we will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing us to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we will find key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers.
