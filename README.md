# Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
**Intepret real-word data to help make a business decision (online relatail)**

## Case Study
The transactional dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. By conducting exploratory data analysis, we will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing us to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we will find key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers.

## Project Objective
Gain valuable insights which can help improve the operation of online retail

## Dataset
Dataset contains transactional data of an online retail store from 2010 to 2011. <br>
The dataset contains the following columns: <br><br>

InvoiceNo  : Invoice number of the transaction<br>
StockCode  : Unique code of the product<br>
Description: Description of the product<br>
Quantity   : Quantity of the product in the transaction<br>
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction<br>
UnitPrice  : Unit price of the product<br>
CustomerID : Unique identifier of the customer<br>
Country    : Country where the transaction occurred<br>

## Graph Used in Project
1) Horizontal bar graph
2) Worldmap
3) Bubble Chart

## Project's Plan
1) Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows to get an overview of the data.<br>
2) Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, if any, and removing any redundant or unnecessary columns.<br>
3) Explore the basic statistics of the dataset, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.<br>
4) Perform data visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Generate appropriate plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar plots, to visualize different aspects of the data.<br>
5) Analyze the sales trends over time. Identify the busiest months and days of the week in terms of sales.<br>
6) Explore the top-selling products and countries based on the quantity sold.<br>
7) Identify any outliers or anomalies in the dataset and discuss their potential impact on the analysis.<br>
8) Draw conclusions and summarize your findings from the exploratory data analysis.<br>
